# 🫱🏻‍🫲🏽 Contributing

To contribute to D-Jà Vue, since it is a project template, the process is a bit different from the usual (opening a PR and merging). That’s why we’ve created this page, to answer frequently asked questions you may have.

## Contribution Tutorial:

These are the steps:
- [Fork the project to your account](https://github.com/evolutio/djavue3/fork)
- Clone the project to your computer
- Create a new branch
- Make your changes
- Commit your changes
- Push your branch
- Open a PR from your forked project to the original repository: evolutio/djavue3

## 📦 How to test the changes I made in my branch?

When creating a new project, instead of using the default command `cookiecutter gh:evolutio/djavue3`, you can run `cookiecutter \homeuser\workspace\djavue3`, where the second argument is the location of your forked project. This command will make cookiecutter use your version, with your changes, to generate the project. That way, you can validate the new features even before committing them to your working branch.

### ⚠️ Warnings

<p>
    When making changes, keep in mind that D-Jà Vue is a project template that continuously gains new features and capabilities. This means a single change might affect various aspects, as D-Jà Vue can generate projects in a variety of forms.
</p>
<p>
    With that in mind, it’s very important that before proposing a PR, the changes are thoroughly validated across different scenarios where D-Jà Vue might be used.

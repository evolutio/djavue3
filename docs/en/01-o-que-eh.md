# 💡 Introduction

## Why?

We want a workflow and a project structure to make us produtive and make the stakeholders happy. We know we'll make mistakes. Let us make them cheaply.

## What is D-Jà Vue?

D-Jà Vue is a **project template** that will create a folder and files structure that contains two projects, a **Django API backend** and a **VueJS + Vuetify frontend**. It can be a great jumpstarting to your next project, Proof of Concept or product idea. It's  production-ready where you can focus on the features, core business and generate value. 

## How?

By answering some questions, you can give the project name and choose things such as the database version, the main model for your project and few other things, then a complete project structure will be created 📂! Then it's possible to start the main feature for your business on the Day one.

## Some principles

- Start by building a backend-less frontend
- Start with the output and test the hypothesis
- Deploy early, deploy often
- TDD is the fastest way
